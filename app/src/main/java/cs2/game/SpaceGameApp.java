     * with a collection (probably ArrayList) of Bullets.
     * 
     * You should create a KeyPressed event handler that moves the player
     * when the left or right arrow keys are pressed, and fires a bullet when
     * the space bar is pressed. Add the bullet created to the collection.
     * 
     * You should also create an AnimationTimer that displays everything and
     * moves the bullets around the screen. Also, an enemy chosen from the swarm
     * at random should shoot and have that bullet added to the collection.
